A snap fit bracket to mount a Teyleten Robot ESP32-WROOM board to
an aluminum U-channel LED strip mount. Attaches so the ESP32s pins
are sticking up toward the LED side for easy dupont wiring. Works
with one meter by 17mm outside U-channel popular with LED mounting.

Not super attractive, but good for hidden mounting or for demo
purposes. See photos directory to see what it looks like.
