What you'll find here is a case for the venerable DOIT ESP32 Devkit V1.
This is an early model of ESP32 board. It's the one that doesn't fit on
a breadboard very well. You'll recognize it by its wide stance and four
mounting holes, one in each corner.

But, what this board lacks in breadboarding appeal, it more than makes
up for with its other features.

* It's cheap! The price is on par with the older, less capable 8266.
* GPIO2 features a blue LED. Good status indicator without extra parts.
* The CP2102 USB bridge and LM1117 regulator make it stable and easy.
* It has Bluetooth in addition to WiFi.
* The mounting holes make it a breeze to... well... mount!

The case I have here can be printed and used as is, or you can grab
the original FreeCAD drawings and customize it to fit your needs.

The top piece is currently secured by friction in an interference
fit. It is working, but not ideal. It may need a little glue.
