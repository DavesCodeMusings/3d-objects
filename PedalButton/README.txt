This is a cap for guitar effects pedal switches that makes it
easier to stomp the pedal switch with bare feet. It's similar
to the ones sold at guitar stores for around $10 US, though not
as fancy. It relies on friction fit and does not have set screws.
It fits a 10mm switch, which is a common diameter.

The fit has been tested successfully on:
* TC Polytune 3
* Electro-Harmonix Bass Soul Food
* MXR Bass Fuzz Deluxe
* Keely Seafoam Plus

Measure your switch diameter. Your mileage may vary.
